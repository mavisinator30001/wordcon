# WordCon
A work in progress python program with the purpose of easily expanding wordlists.


# How Do I Run It?
Download the concat.py file and simply run it through the directory you desire and follow the instructions that the program provides

# Tips
The input files *must* be text files, and the name of the text files must end in '.txt' or the program will return an error

The words in the input files *must* be seperated by line return, failing to do so concatenates lines to lines, resulting in an unsatisfactory output

The end of the input text files must end in an empty line or the results will be combined wrong (to be fixed in the future)


# Roadmap
Add option to add an entire input file rather than only one key phrase to append to the original word list [COMPLETED]

Add support for larger text files, such as, rockyou.txt


... More plans will be formulated in the future, should anyone be interested and support my work


I do realize that there are other languages and, perhaps, even software, that might make this easier. However, I chose Python because it was familiar and I knew I could find a way to 'coax' the code to do what I wanted. I also intentionally did not use libraries, I wanted this to be all my own work.
